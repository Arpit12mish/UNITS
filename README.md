# BUSINESS MODEL

1. Customized solutions, pay-per-use for real-time detection in serverless or edge computing environments, and monetization through threat intelligence sharing.
2. Transition to edge and IoT markets with adaptive pricing and cloud integration.
3. Subscription-based SaaS (Software as a Service), licensing for integration with enterprise systems, or revenue-sharing agreements with hardware vendors (e.g., antivirus providers).
4. Deploy subscription or licensing models for SMEs and individual users.

# DISPOSABLE UNITS BROWSER

1. Units Disposable Browser enables anonymous browsing from any location. Unlike Incognito which does not change your actual IP address. Thus in terms of anonymity, Units is a much better choice than VPN or Incognito.
2. VPNs and Incognito are not equipped to combat modern threats, as they were designed at a time when the primary threats were file viruses, worms, and network attacks.
3. Units ensure that a user's identity and data are decoupled when accessing the internet. This ensures that even the most sophisticated website trackers fail to track and log the user's activities and tie them to their identity.
4. However, in Units, your data is not logged in data centers like Incognito nor given up like VPN companies.

# MALWARE DETECTION
1. Multi-Engine Malware Scanning
